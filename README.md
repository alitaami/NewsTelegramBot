# NewsBot in Telegram

Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹!

I've created a Telegram bot using ASP.NET. This bot is designed to notify users about the latest currency news and offers many other features for your convenience.

Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to deploy this bot yet, but you can still test and use it locally. Here's how:

    Clone the project to your local machine.
    Build the project.
    Use Swagger UI to connect to the bot by executing the 'SetBotConnection' endpoint.
    Once connected, you can start interacting with the bot by sending a message to its Telegram ID: @TaamiNews_bot.

I've chosen SQLite as the database for its lightweight nature, and I've placed the database file within the project files for easy access.
